video quality needs way more than only changing CRF; quality consists of many other things

video extract audio:
Processing failed: ffmpeg exited with code 1: Output #0, mp3, to 'C:\Users\calm-\Downloads\5538262-hd_1920_1080_25fps_pitched_audio.mp3': Output file #0 does not contain any stream
This is only happening for certain (corrupted ?) video files

audio trimming

For speeding up videos or audios, the process is completing before the progress gets to 100%,
because the duration of the new video or audio (if the playback is increases not decreased) would
be less than the original

remove this when cancelling a process and keep the Process Cancled message:
Processing failed: ffmpeg was killed with signal SIGTERM (should be done)

for tagging new releases:
- first the package version should be the same as the tag
- git add .
- git commit -m "message"
- git push origin main
- git tag v(x.x.x)
- gut push origin v(x.x.x)
