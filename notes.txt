video quality needs way more than only changing CRF; quality consists of many other things

audio trimming

For speeding up videos or audios, the process is completing before the progress gets to 100%,
because the duration of the new video or audio (if the playback is increases not decreased) would
be less than the original

remove this when cancelling a process and keep the Process Cancled message:
Processing failed: ffmpeg was killed with signal SIGTERM (should be done)

for tagging new releases:
- first the package version should be the same as the tag
- git add .
- git commit -m "message"
- git push origin main
- git tag v(x.x.x)
- gut push origin v(x.x.x)
