video quality
video converting not working (keeping it mp4)

audio trimming
audio silence remover
audio spectrogram
audio equalizer
audio fading backend (?)

For speeding up videos or audios, the process is completing before the progress gets to 100%,
because the duration of the new video or audio (if the playback is increases not decreased) would
be less than the original

remove this when cancelling a process and keep the Process Cancled message:
Processing failed: ffmpeg was killed with signal SIGTERM
